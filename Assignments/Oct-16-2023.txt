9. Boxing is the process of converting a primitive data type into its corresponding wrapper class object, like converting int to Integer. Unboxing is the reverse process, converting a wrapper object back to its primitive data type.

10. Keywords: Reserved words with predefined meanings in Java, like "if," "class," "int," used for specific language purposes.

    Identifiers: Names given to classes, variables, methods, etc., following rules for naming conventions.

    Literals: Represent fixed values like numbers or strings directly written in code (e.g. 5, "Hello").
